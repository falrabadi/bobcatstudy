# Study Room Availability

This is a student project being worked on by the group Programming Paladins. Its goal is to create a website, iOS, and Android app that Ohio University students can use to find available study rooms. It will use sensors installed in various study rooms to determine if they are occupied or not and display that information on the website and mobile apps.

The website can be found [here](http://bobcatstudy.net).

## Documentation

* You can find our SRS / Design document in [documentation/Programming Paladins - SRS and Design 1.3.docx](documentation/Programming%20Paladins%20-%20SRS%20and%20Design%201.3.docx)
* You can find documentation on the Raspberry Pi and python script in [documentation/Raspberry Pi.md](documentation/Raspberry%20Pi.md)
* You can find information on how to deploy our software in [documentation/Deployment.md](documentation/Deployment.md)

## How to build
